Show all categories linked to a blog post/page, or list data such as: title, id, author details, tag.. & add hyperlinks or filter on specific data!

== Description ==
So, you are tired of retyping data within your post. You want a quicker way to import data based on your post or page settings into, for example, a review table?
You just need one specific category to show up within your blog post? And maybe you´d want a hyperlink added too?

Search no further! We created this beatifull plugin to make this happen.

By using a very simple Shortcode you will be able to show all Categories related to a Blog Post or Page.
Even better; you will be able to filter within specific Parent Categories. And ofcourse there are times you want to show or hide the Parent Category ,and that is no problem too! 
Oh, and before we forget you can choose wether to show this as Hyperlink or not. Just so that your visitor has a simplified UX.

But it does not end there; we are constantly working on new features. This plugin isn´t limited to just showing categories; 
You can print the author details, the page/post title, it´s unique ID, etc..

I hope you will enjoy this plugin, if you do come over and say thanks at [willemso.com](https://willemso.com/category/show-post-categories/), suggestions for improvement and features are welcome!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to use "show Post Categories"? =

1. Install the plugin files
2. Activate plugin
3. In your blog post type: **[show_post_categories]**

= How to show categories? =

`[show_post_categories show="category"]`

Default settings:

* *show all categories linked to blog post*
* *no hyperlinks*
* *include all parent categories*
* *do not filter on any specific parent category*

Optional settings, that can overrule above default values:

* `hyperlink="yes"`
* `hyperlinktarget="_blank"`
* `parent="no"` 
* `parentcategory="EXACT NAME or ID of PARENT CATEGORY"`
* `id="POST OR PAGE NUMBER // POST OR PAGE TITLE"`
* `taxonomy="YOUR CUSTOM CATEGORY TAXONOMY NAME"`

You can leave taxonomy empty if custom taxonomy is been used; Show Post Categories will detect it automatically. Manual input only there in case of strange behaviour

= How to show title? =

`[show_post_categories show="title"]`

Default settings:

* *show blog post title / page title*
* *no hyperlink*

Optional settings, that can overrule above default values:

attribute could be: 
* url

Optional settings, that can overrule above default values:

* `id="POST OR PAGE NUMBER // POST OR PAGE TITLE"`
* `hyperlink="yes"`
* `hyperlinktarget="_blank"`
* `taxonomy="YOUR CUSTOM CATEGORY TAXONOMY NAME"`

* `id="POST OR PAGE NUMBER // POST OR PAGE TITLE"`
* `attribute="see below.."`

= Can I change the separator for 1 time? =

Yes, ie;

`[show_post_categories show="category" separator="| "]`

= Can I change default behaviour of the separator? =

Yes;

* Select **settings** at the admin dashboard, go to **Show Post Categories**
* Modify the default value of the textbox next to "separator"

You will still be able to modify this separator on an ad hoc basis.

= Can I modify the default hyperlink target? =

Yes;

* Select **settings** at the admin dashboard, go to **Show Post Categories** 
* Modify the default value of the dropdown next to "Hyperlink target"

= Can I change the language settings? =

We are working on I18n. We did however implement a quick workaround;

* Select **settings** at the admin dashboard, go to **Show Post Categories**
* Modify the default value of the textboxes

= Can I reset to default values? =

Sure, we implemented a reset button for this purpose..

* Select **settings** at the admin dashboard, go to **Show Post Categories**
* Hit the button..

= What happens if I desinstall ? =
We like good practices, so during the deinstall process we´ll remove all files and settings. Your database will have no trace of Show Post Categories.
However this means that custom settings will be removed too.

Once deinstalled you will need to remove all shortcode tags you´ve ever entered or it will show the used code without output..
